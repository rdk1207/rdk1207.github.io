            This website has been a long time coming. I've been meaning to put it together for a while. I've even had domains purchased for it for years without ever pointing them to content.

            Now I can finally say I have a few (mediocre) things to show. This is the first post of a blog I'd like to keep adding to regularly as I fine tune my skills in both writing and web development.

            This entire site's style was created in a day after being inspired by <a href="https://jrl.ninja/etc/1/">this post</a> on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19607169">hacker news</a>. This was the perfect minimalistic style that wouldn't distract me from actually pushing the content out, and I have to thank Josh for that.

            More to come!
